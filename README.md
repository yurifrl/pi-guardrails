# Guardrails

Guardrails adds safety checks to Pi so agents are less likely to read secrets, write protected files, access paths outside the workspace, or run dangerous shell commands by accident.

This package installs five Pi extensions:

- **guardrails** for file protection policies, settings, onboarding, and examples.
- **path-access** for controlling access outside the current workspace.
- **permission-gate** for confirming or blocking risky shell commands.
- **guidance** for soft-blocking commands with a message to the model, with an opt-in escalation to a user prompt.
- **herdr** for reporting Guardrails approval prompts to Herdr.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@aliou/pi-guardrails
```

## First run

After installing, run the onboarding command to choose a starting setup:

```text
/guardrails:onboarding
```

You can change everything later with:

```text
/guardrails:settings
```

## Included extensions

### guardrails

The `guardrails` extension owns file protection policies and the user-facing commands.

Use it to protect files like `.env`, private keys, local credentials, generated logs, database dumps, or any project-specific path you do not want Pi to read or modify without clear intent.

[![Guardrails policies and settings walkthrough](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/policies.gif)](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/policies.mp4)

Useful commands:

```text
/guardrails:settings
/guardrails:onboarding
/guardrails:examples
```

#### Herdr integration

The included Herdr adapter reports active Guardrails approval prompts through Herdr's `herdr:blocked` event. Herdr can then show the Pi pane as blocked while it waits for a permission-gate or path-access decision.

The adapter has no configuration or direct Herdr dependency. Its emitted events have no effect unless Herdr's Pi integration is active.

### path-access

The `path-access` extension checks tool calls that target paths outside the current working directory.

It can allow, block, or ask before Pi accesses files elsewhere on your machine. In ask mode, you can allow one file or a directory once, for the session, or always.

Granted paths are stored in `pathAccess.allowedPaths` as explicit `{ kind, path }` entries: `file` matches the exact path, `directory` matches the directory and its descendants. Edit them through `/guardrails:settings` (Path Access → Allowed paths, Tab toggles file/directory) or directly in the settings file. Paths support `~/` for home. Existing configs using the legacy string form (trailing `/` for directories) are migrated automatically.

### permission-gate

The `permission-gate` extension detects dangerous bash commands before they run.

It catches built-in risky patterns like recursive deletes, privileged commands, disk formatting, broad permission changes, and configured custom patterns. You can allow once, allow for the session, deny, decline and stop (which also aborts the current turn), or configure auto-deny rules.

[![Guardrails permission gate walkthrough](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/permission-gate.gif)](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/permission-gate.mp4)

### guidance

The `guidance` extension soft-blocks bash commands that match configured patterns and returns a guidance message to the model **without prompting you**. Use it to steer the agent away from actions you almost never want (for example `git checkout`, which can destroy uncommitted work) while leaving an escape hatch.

When a command matches, the call is blocked and the pattern's `message` is returned verbatim to the model. If the model still needs the command, it re-runs it with a trailing `# guardrails:approve <reason>` marker; the extension then opens a normal approval prompt (Allow once / Allow for session / Deny / Decline and stop) showing the command **and the model's stated reason**, so you decide with context. The trailing marker is a bash comment, so the approved command runs unchanged.

This extension is intentionally self-contained (its own `guidance.json` config, its own matcher, no dependency on the other extensions) so it can be maintained independently.

Configure it in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/guidance.json` (global) or `.pi/extensions/guidance.json` (project):

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "patterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "git checkout",
      "message": "git checkout is blocked here — reverse your own edits with the edit tool instead. If you truly need it, re-run with a trailing `# guardrails:approve <reason>` and the user will be asked."
    },
    {
      "pattern": "^rm -rf /",
      "message": "Refusing to wipe from root. Re-run with `# guardrails:approve <reason>` to ask the user.",
      "regex": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Each pattern is matched as a substring of the raw command by default, or as a full regular expression when `regex` is `true`. Patterns from the global and project files are combined.

## Extension events

Guardrails emits paired prompt lifecycle events on Pi's shared event bus:

- `guardrails:prompt:opened` when an interactive Guardrails prompt starts waiting for input.
- `guardrails:prompt:closed` when that prompt stops waiting, including when the UI throws.

Both events include the same `prompt.id` for correlation.

## Configuration

Most configuration should happen through the interactive settings UI:

```text
/guardrails:settings
```

Advanced users can edit the settings file directly:

- Global: `~/.pi/agent/extensions/guardrails.json`
- Project: `.pi/extensions/guardrails.json`

Guardrails writes a `$schema` field to saved settings files, so modern editors provide autocomplete and validation. The generated schema is committed at [`schema.json`](schema.json).

## Examples

Use the examples command to add common policy and command presets without replacing your existing config:

```text
/guardrails:examples
```

[![Guardrails examples command walkthrough](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/examples.gif)](https://assets.aliou.me/github/aliou/pi-guardrails/v0.12.0/examples.mp4)

The available presets live in [`extensions/guardrails/commands/settings/examples.ts`](extensions/guardrails/commands/settings/examples.ts).

## Similar but different

Pi is designed to make agent safety extensible. Guardrails focuses on deterministic, configurable file policies, outside-workspace path access, and dangerous-command prompts. Other packages tend to fall into two useful groups.

See [pi.dev/packages](https://pi.dev/packages) for the full registry of Pi extensions.

### Make one yourself!

If Guardrails or the alternatives below do not fit your needs, you can also make your own. Start from the [Pi permission gate example](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/permission-gate.ts), then ask Pi to customize it for your workflow.

### Permission and policy gates

These packages add checks around tool calls before they run. They are closest to Guardrails when you want policy enforcement without changing where Pi executes.

- [@gotgenes/pi-permission-system](https://pi.dev/packages/%40gotgenes/pi-permission-system): broad permission enforcement for Pi tool calls.
- [@vtstech/pi-security](https://pi.dev/packages/%40vtstech/pi-security): command, path, network, mode, and audit controls.
- [pi-control](https://github.com/mcowger/pi-control/blob/main/README.md): location-scoped, action-based policies for tool calls, with allow, log, ask, and deny outcomes before execution.
- [@casualjim/pi-heimdall](https://pi.dev/packages/%40casualjim/pi-heimdall): secret exposure guards, command policies, protected `.env` files, and a sandbox guard.
- [pi-file-permissions](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-file-permissions): file-level permissions for read, write, edit, find, grep, and ls tools.
- [pi-secret-guard](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-secret-guard): focused protection against committing or pushing secrets to git.

### Sandboxes and containment

These packages reduce blast radius by running Pi, subagents, or tool calls inside a constrained environment. They can be a better fit when you want isolation first and prompts second.

- [Pi + Gondolin sandbox example](https://github.com/earendil-works/gondolin/blob/main/host/examples/pi-gondolin.ts): upstream example that runs Pi tools inside a Gondolin micro-VM.
- [pi-sandbox](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-sandbox): OS-level sandboxing for bash, with allow/deny checks and prompts for file tools.
- [pi-container-sandbox](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-container-sandbox): runs read, write, edit, bash, and user bash operations inside a Docker or Apple container session.
- [@alexanderfortin/pi-freestyle-sandbox](https://pi.dev/packages/%40alexanderfortin/pi-freestyle-sandbox): runs sandboxed subagents in Freestyle cloud VMs.
- [@the-agency/vmpi](https://pi.dev/packages/%40the-agency/vmpi): runs Pi inside a QEMU microVM with limited filesystem and network access.
- [pi-claude-sandbox](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-claude-sandbox): Claude-style OS sandboxing with interactive permission prompts.
